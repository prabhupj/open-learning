  <h1>Solar System</h1>
  <hr>
  <p>
    An attempt to create open learning for all kids in our solar system :)
  </p>
  <p>
    Here is a true time scaled solar-system, which means that every objects have a time relative to an Earth year.
    You can change the number in second of the
    <br>
    <code>$year-in-second</code>
    variable to increase the speed of revolutions. Here 1 year = 30 seconds.

    Note the css tricks for the Saturn rings (box-shadow) and reverse animation to compensate the orbit.
